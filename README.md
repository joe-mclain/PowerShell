# PowerShell
This is a collection of scripts that have had value to me and that I am sharing in the hopes that they will have value to you as well.

It should be assumed that all scripts are optimized for PowerShell 7 unless PowerShell 5 is required. That doesn't mean that they won't work; it's more of a heads up that if you discover something wonky you may want to check the version and see if there are any conflicts.

I've done my best to make sure that all of these scripts are production ready but that doesn't mean that the occasional script doesn't squirt past me and stand in the Gold Code line without my noticing. If you find errors in anything my request is that you do one or both of the following:
* Fix it, test it, and upload your revised copy. If you do this, make sure you credit yourself in the header!
* Let me know so I can fix it
The one thing I specifically ask when you discover an error is that you not walk away from it. At least let me know so I can fix it so it's ready for others!

My goal in sharing these is to make others' lives a bit easier. I appreciate your help in doing that. Use what I have, spread the word, and feel free to add your scripts to my library so even more of us can benefit.
